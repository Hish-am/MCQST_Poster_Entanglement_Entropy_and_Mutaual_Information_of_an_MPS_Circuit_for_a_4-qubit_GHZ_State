# MCQST_Poster_Entanglement_Entropy_and_Mutaual_Information_of_an_MPS_Circuit_for_a_4-qubit_GHZ_State
An adjusted poster based off of my MCQST2020 poster, adjustments were made after some insightful comments about my original during the presentation, including using state tomography to derive the pre-measuremnt density matrix. luckily I corrected the pointed mistakes here.In addition, since the original was part of a virtual exhibition, some of the key annotations were included as popups and videos, so I re arranged and added to the original format posted online to include all annotations and figures.  

### some results:  
  
This is the figure illustrating the correspondance between Matrix Product States and Quantum Circuits, the example here is the 4-Qubit GHZ State Circuit:

This is the inferred tomographic density matrix we assumed would reflect the decoherence seen in an experimental setting from the quantum computer:
