# MCQST_Poster_Entanglement_Entropy_and_Mutaual_Information_of_an_MPS_Circuit_for_a_4-qubit_GHZ_State
An adjusted poster based off of my MCQST2020 poster, adjustments were made after some insightful comments about my original, luckily I corrected the pointed mistakes here.In addition, since the original was part of a virtual exhibition, some of the key annotations were included as popups and videos, so I re arranged and added to the original format posted online to include all annotations and figures.  

### some results:  
  
This is the figure illustrating the correspondance between Matrix Product States and Quantum Circuits, the example here is the 4-Qubit GHZ State Circuit:

This is the "Hypothetical would-be" inferred density matrix we assumed would reflect the decoherence seen in an experimental setting from the quantum computer:
